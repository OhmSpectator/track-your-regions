# API Documentation and Definitions

## Overview

This directory is intended to contain API definitions, schemas, and related
files. It serves as the central location for all API-related resources, ensuring
standardized communication between the frontend and backend components of the
Region Tracker service.

## Structure

This directory is organized as follows:

- [**`api.yaml`**](./api.yaml): This file contains the API definitions and
  schemas for the Region Tracker service. Later on, this file may be split into
  separate files for different roles (e.g. user, admin, etc.) or components (
  e.g. frontend, backend, etc.).

## Guidelines

- Always keep the API documentation and domain model up-to-date with the latest
  changes.
- Ensure that any new endpoints or domain changes are properly documented and
  tested.
- Follow the established naming conventions for consistency.
